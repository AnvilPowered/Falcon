Falcon is a discord bot that aims to help guilds that focus on development.

Typically, when a user has an issue they send the entire log as a file instead of using
a paste site. Look no further, Falcon is here to help. Falcon will download the file and
upload it to a paste site, alleviating the struggle to get the user to upload it themselves.
